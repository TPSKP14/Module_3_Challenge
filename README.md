# Module_3_Challenge

Overview of Election Audit: The purpose of the Election Audit was to review all the votes over 3 counties and determine if the votes were counted accurately.  We helped Seth and Tom find the total number of votes, a list of candidates, a list of counties, and the corresponding vote totals and percentages associated with the counties and candidates.  We were able to determine the winner fo the election down to the vote

Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

 Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.  
  -Our script was extremely efficient, easy to use, and flawless in it's execution of the congressional vote count.  The code itself will work with any data set provided the       data is structured in the same way as the election_results.csv.  Even if the structure were different, the script could be adjusted to match the new data.  We could modify the   script futher to include county turnout, so you could take the legal voting aged population of each county against the real turnout for the election.  The script could be       adjusted for another data set that included the town or municiple located within each county to further analyze the data.  If there were another row added for town we would be   able to provide even more insight after the election and project the election data onto a map even more accurately.
